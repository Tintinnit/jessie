## TODO

- When a task name is too long, it pushes towards the edge of the box. This is an issue in the side panel too.
- Possibly make the box bigger
- Add a confirmation message to deleting each task
- Make edit and dlete buttons into pencil and trash can logo
- Need to add style for delete confirmation
